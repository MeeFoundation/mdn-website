The MDN is a data network of compatible apps/sites where the information held by them is controlled by your identity agent. This agent can be either local (Mee Smartwallet app) or virtual (web-based identity agent (soon at itsmee.org)) hosted by the Foundation. 

The MDN is under development, so there is nothing for end-users to play with quite yet. When it's ready you'll be able to sign up for an account on itsmee.org or download and install the Mee Smartwallet app. Using either of these agents you'll be able to remotely control your personal data held by MDN-compatible apps and websites when these become available.
