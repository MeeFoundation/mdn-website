MeeQL is a query language for accessing and manipulating data in the Mee Data Network. It provides a familiar Python-like syntax while offering powerful capabilities for working with personal data across contexts.

Please note that the language specification is currently in active development and is subject to change.

### Basic Syntax

MeeQL queries use a list comprehension-like syntax:

```python
[
  result_expression
  for item in source()
  statements...
]
```

The basic components are:

- An optional result expression that defines what data to return
- A main iterator that specifies the data source
- Additional statements like filters, assignments, and operations

### Operations

#### Select

Select queries retrieve data from a source. The simplest form returns all fields:

```python
[
  user
  for user in users()
]
```

You can select specific fields:

```python
[
  {
    "name": user.name,
    "email": user.email
  }
  for user in users()
]
```

#### Filter

Use `if` statements to filter results:

```python
[
  user
  for user in users()
  if user.age >= 18 and user.country == "USA"
]
```

Supported comparison operators:

- `==`, `!=` - Equality comparison
- `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` - Numeric comparison
- `matches` - Regular expression matching
- `contains` - Array/string containment
- `exists` - Check for non-null values

#### Update

Update data using the `set` statement:

```python
[
  for user in users() if user.id == "4435"
  set user.payment_cards = [
    {"number": "1234 5678 9012 3456", "expires": "08/30"}
  ]
]
```

#### Delete

Remove data using the `delete` statement:

```python
[
  for user in users() if user.id == "534622344"
  delete user
]
```

#### Pagination

Control result size using `limit` and `offset`:

```python
[
  user
  for user in users()
  offset 100
  limit 25
]
```

### Query Examples

#### Find Users by Email

```python
[
  user
  for user in users()
  if user.email == "alice@example.com"
]
```

#### Complex Queries with Multiple Conditions

```python
[
  {
    "name": user.name,
    "flight": flight.number,
    "card": payment_card.number
  }
  for user in users()
  for flight in user.flights
    if flight.number == "UA123" and flight.date == "2024-12-25"
  payment_card = (card for card in user.payment_cards limit 1)
  if payment_card exists
]
```

#### Aggregation

MeeQL supports basic aggregation operations like sum, count, min, and max:

```python
[
  {
    "email": user.email,
    "total_spent": sum([order.total for order in user.orders])
  }
  for user in users()
]
```

### Data Types

MeeQL currently supports the following data types:

- Numbers (integers and floating point)
- Strings (in double quotes)
- Booleans (`true`, `false`)
- `null`
- Arrays
- Objects (key-value pairs)

### Error Handling

MeeQL will provide error reporting for:

- Syntax errors
- Missing required fields
- Invalid data types
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Non-existent paths

The exact error format is TBD.
