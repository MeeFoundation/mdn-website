## Agent App

An application that allows the user to control their [personal data](#personal-data) and their [identity agent's](#identity-agent) behavior. It could be a [Mee Smartwallet](#mee-smartwallet) or a [Mee web app](#mee-web-app).

## Agent App SDK

A Software Development Kit (SDK) that provides the functionality needed to implement an [agent app](#agent-app).

## Capability

A reference to a set of [claims](#claim) about a [subject](#subject) together with a set of access rights that defines what operations can be performed on that set of [claims](#claim). A capability is non-repudiable and can only be obtained through legitimate means (e.g. [delegation](#delegated-claim)).

## Claim

An assertion made about a [subject](#subject) in an [identity context](#identity-context). [Claims](#claim) have [types](#claim-type) (e.g. given-name) and values (e.g. "Fred").

## Claim Type

A type of a [claim](#claim). It can be primitive or composite. The details of claim types are to be specified.

## Connection

A special type of [claim](#claim) that declares a data-sharing relationship between a [user](#user) and a [relying party](#relying-party).

## Custodian Account

An account of a [user](#user) or a [service provider](#service-provider) who hosts an [MDN node](#mdn-node) and is responsible for making the [personal data](#personal-data) of a [user](#user) available to other participants of [Mee data network](#mee-data-network) (other [MDN nodes](#mdn-node)), with respect to specified [capabilities](#capability). 

## Context-scoped Identity <a name="context-scoped-identity"></a>

Unique identifier of the [user](#user) associated with a specific [identity context](#identity-context). It is known only to the [relying party](#relying-party) of this [identity context](#identity-context) and to the [identity agent](#identity-agent).

## Delegated Claim

A [claim](#claim) of a specific [identity context](#identity-context) that has been conditionally shared with another [identity context](#identity-context). The conditions of the claim delegation are specified by the [capability](#capability). It is required for the delegated claim to refer to the [user](#user) by the [context-scoped identity](#context-scoped-identity) associated with the specific context. In other words, if a claim is shared between context A and context B then in context A it should refer to the user by the context-scoped identity associated with context A. And in context B it should refer to the user by the context-scoped identity associated with context B. The [identity agent](#identity-agent) is responsible for performing substitution and resolution of context-scoped identities.

## Identity Agent

A part of [Mee data network](#mee-data-network) that is responsible for data sharing between [users](#user) and [service providers](#service-provider) with respect to [context-scoped identities](#context-scoped-identity) and [capability](#capability) validation. 

## Identity Context

A set of [claims](#claim) about a [person](#person) in the context of a relationship with [relying party](#relying-party) identified by a [context-scoped identity](#context-scoped-identity).

## Local App

An application that runs on the user's local devices (e.g. smartphone, tablet, or laptop)

## MDN License

To operate on the [Mee data network](#mee-data-network) service providers must be authorized by the Mee Foundation and agree to the terms of the MDN license agreement. This agreement licenses the userâ€™s [personal data](#personal-data) to the [service provider](#service-provider) and states what they can and cannot do with it. For example, it requires the [service provider's](#service-provider) apps to get opt-in consent from the user before sharing/selling their data to other entities. It also requires that the [service provider's](#service-provider) apps implement MDN protocols so they can interoperate with the [identity agent](#identity-agent).

## MDN Node

A service that stores [personal data](#personal-data) of the [user](#user) and implements the set of protocols required to synchronize the data over [Mee data network](#mee-data-network). It could be hosted either by the [user](#user) or by [service provider](#service-provider). If the MDN node is hosted by the [service provider](#service-provider) it must store only the data for the [identity contexts](#identity-context) associated with this [service provider](#service-provider). 

## Mee Data Network (MDN) <a name="mee-data-network"></a>

Mee data network is an instance of [identity agent](#identity-agent) together with the [MDN nodes](#mdn-node) that are compatible with that specific [identity agent](#identity-agent).

## Mee Smartwallet

A [local app](#local-app) that provides [agent app](#agent-app) functionality and [MDN node](#mdn-node) functionality.

## Mee-compatible

Mee-compatible is an adjective applied to a [service provider app](#service-provider-app) wherein the user's [personal data](#personal-data) involved in a data sharing connection with this app is subject to the terms of the [MDN license](#mdn-license). To be Mee-compatible an app may also have to adhere to specific UI guidelines.

## Mee Identity

An account in the [Mee data network](#mee-data-network) with a unique identifier, together with the information needed to prove ownership of the account (e.g. email and password, or the key pair). Mee identity is tied to the [self](#self) of the [user](#user) and is known only to the [user](#user) and to their [identity agent](#identity-agent).

## Mee Web App

A web-based [agent app](#agent-app) that is hosted by Mee. It does not persist [personal data](#personal-data) of the [user](#user) and does not provide the functionality of [MDN node](#mdn-node).

## Personal Data

Information that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked with the user or the user's household. This data includes names, addresses, contact information, payment information, lists of friends, preferences, interests, medical records, etc.

## Relying Party (RP) <a name="relying-party"></a>

A [subject](#subject) with which the [user](#user) interacts using an [identity agent](#identity-agent). Relying party may be another [user](#user) (with [Mee identity](#mee-identity)), a [person](#person) (without [Mee identity](#mee-identity)), a [service provider](#service-provider) or another source of personal data.

## Self

A set of [claims](#claim) about a single [person](#person) that represents the holistic [selfness](#selfness) of the [person](#person) 

## Self-hosted 

A resource that is hosted on servers that an individual [user](#user) manages for themself.

A website, web service, mobile, tablet, laptop, or desktop application provided by a [service provider](#service-provider). A service provider app must provide an [MDN node](#mdn-node) functionality.

## Service Provider App SDK

A software development kit that enables a [service provider app](#service-provider-app) to communicate with [MDN node](#mdn-node) hosted by the [service provider](#service-provider). 

## Subject

A thing about which [claims](#claim) may be made.

### Corporation

A [subject](#subject) that represents an incorporated legal entity.
