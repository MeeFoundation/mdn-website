The Mee Data Network (MDN) is a protocol and infrastructure layer that enables privacy-preserving personal data management and sharing between individuals and service providers. Its primary goal is to let users maintain control of their personal information.

MDN uses a hybrid architecture combining centralized coordination with distributed data storage and direct p2p data exchange. Data relationships between participants are always isolated.

Refer to the [Terminology](./terminology/) page for definitions of terms used in the MDN documentation.

## How it works

The participants in the Mee Data Network are either individual Users or Service Providers. Each relationship between participants is represented as an Identity Context, which contains a set of claims about the User in the context of their relationship with the Relying Party (either a Service Provider or another User).

Service Providers integrate MDN into their application by implementing the Mee auth flow, hosting MDN Nodes and querying them using the Service Provider App SDK and the [MeeQL Query Language](./meeql-query-language). Users can then authorize Service Providers to access their data via their Agent App (either the Mee Website or the Mee Smartwallet).

See [Core components](./core-components) and [MeeQL Query Language](./meeql-query-language) for details

## Data synchronization

We use the [Willow protocol](https://willowprotocol.org/) for data synchronization logic and [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/) for peer-to-peer networking.

See the [Data Synchronization](./data-synchronization) page for more information

## Security Model

Security is enforced through multiple mechanisms:


1. Data encryption in transit and at rest
2. Fine grained [capability-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) data access
3. Identity scoping (each identity context has its own scoped identifiers which prevents correlation across contexts)
4. A data synchronization mechanism which does not leak private data

See [Capability system](./capability-system) and  [Data Synchronization](./data-synchronization) for details.
